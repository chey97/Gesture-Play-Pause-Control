# Hand Gesture Play/Pause Control

This Python script allows you to play/pause media using hand gestures detected via a webcam. By checking the position of your palm, you can control the playback state of media on your macOS.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## Usage - PlayPauseHandControlModule

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have installed the required dependencies.
3. Run the `PlayPauseHandControlModule.py` script.
4. Hold your hand in front of the webcam, with your palm facing towards the camera.
5. Open your palm to play the media and close it to pause.

## Configuration

- The script uses an AppleScript command to simulate the spacebar press for play/pause functionality. If you're using a different operating system or media player, you may need to modify this part of the script accordingly.
